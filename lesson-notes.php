#1 -- Create a WordPress Plugin from Scratch
<!-- 
MY New adventure begins! May god assist me with whatever I wish to do <3 

The only requirement to create a plugin is we need a unique name for it.
It'll be called itay-plugin

The first file we need to create is the same name of the plugin's name .php that's the main file.

By default WP checks all the folders inside the plugin installation and detects the file with the same plugin folder name of ours and selects all the files inside it and reads them.

View itay-plugin.php

Lets define a global setting:
/*
*
* @package ItayPlugin
*/

This section is identitcal to writing the style in style.css to give WP an ability to recognize the theme.
